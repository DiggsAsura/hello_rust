Ok, back for alittle session. This is very hard. I'm reading the book from O'Riellys, Programming Rust (2nd edidtion 2021), but I start to think it's written on a level like 10 times above my head.
No of the first examples really run and I don't understand jack shit. I might put this book down, 
try find a beginner friendly book on Rust - or just stick to the online free book.
