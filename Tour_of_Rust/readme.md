# Day 7-15 ish? Tour of Rust

Started this, as I find my book way too hard yet. I need babysteps. This one
looks quite promising!

## 6.6.22 - Wrap up
Ok ran throug it all. It gave aoms general ideas about tings, but DEFINETLY have to go deeper on things. Like 14 days of rust now and can still barly write a hello world on my own. This gonnna be rough. Gonna head back to the official rust book and see it it can learn me some more.
