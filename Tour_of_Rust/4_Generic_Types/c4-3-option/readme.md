# Option

Rust has a built in generic enum called Option that allows us to represent nullable values
without using null.

enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}

This enum is so common, instances of the enum can be created anywhwere with the enum variants
Some and None.



Note to self: ok dont understand shit rn but thats ok.
