# What Is OOP?

Object oriented programming roughly refers to programming languages that have
a number of iconic features:

* **Encapsulation** - Associating data and functions into the conceptual unit of a single type called an object.
* **Abstraction** - Hiding data and function members to obfuscate implementation details of an object.
* **Polymorphism** - The ability to interact with objects of different types through one interface.
* **Inheritance** - The ability to inherit data and behavior from other objects.
