# Rust is Not OOP

Rust lacks inheritance of data and behavior in any meaningful way.

* Structs cannot inherit fields from a parent struct.
* Structs cannot inherit functions from a parent struct.

That said, Rust implements many programming language features, so that you might not
mind this lacking.
