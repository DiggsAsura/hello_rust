# Chapter 7 - Object Oriented Programming

Expressing ideas with functions is a proven way of representing behavior and data
(C has been doing it for decades!). Historically, computer science has found other
useful expressive aggregations and abstractions for data. You may be familiar
with object oriented programming (OOP) as one such way. In this chapter we'll
explore the Rust programming language beyond functions.

# Chapter 7 - Conclusion

We now have more language features at hand to represent our ideas clearly! Rust abstractions
might be simple (eh exuse me?) but they are powerful enough to make working with code a joy
(I'm not sure if we're on the same planet). In this chapter, we caught a glimpse of smart 
pointers with Box. In the next chapter we'll learn about how smart pointers can help us 
with other specialized memory situations.
