# Escaping Characters

It's challenging to visually represent certain characters, so escape codes allow us to put a 
symbol in their place.

Rust supports the common codes from C-based languages:

* \n - newline
* \r - carriage return
* \t - tab
* \ \ - (whitout spaces, md wont do double in succession) backslash
* \0 - null
* \' - single-quote
