# Chapter 6 - Text

Now that we understand a bit how Rust thinks of memory, we are prepared to
talk about text in more detail. Rust cares a great deal about international
text and byte level concerns you might not be familiar with from other
languages. That said, Rust has many great tools for managing those
concerns.

# Chapter 6 - Conclusion

Now you know the basics of text! As you have seen, Unicode makes working with text
a bit tricky (no shit sherlock), but the standard library has plenty of functionality
to make it easy to manage.

Up to now, we've mostly looked at Rust from the lens of a procedural paradigm 
(i.e. just functions and data), but it's time we now talk about traits and the 
capabilities unlocked by Rust's object oriented paradigm.
