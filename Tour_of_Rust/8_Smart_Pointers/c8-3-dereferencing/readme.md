# Dereferencing

The process of accessing/manipulating data that is being referred to by a reference (i.e.
**&i32**) is called dereferencing.

References are used to access/manipulate data in two ways:

* Access to the referred data during assignment of variables
* Access to fields or methods of the referred data.

Rust has some powerful operators that allow us to do this.
