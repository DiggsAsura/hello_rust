# Chapter 8 - Smart Pointers

In this chapter we will demystify smart pointers. Let's explore into these data structures that
let us interact with the lowest level of memory. 

Ferris says: "Don't feel overwhelmed by this chapter if you don't feel you can write your own low
level memory management code in one short read. This chapter is mostly to introduce you to some 
useful tools and give a glimpse at how they work!"

# Chapter 8 - Conclusion

Smart pointers are the idioms of Rust programming and let us not have to re-create the
very common patterns of memory usage. With them you are ready to tackle the thoughest
of challenges! Now that we have the foundations of Rust, let's talk a bit about how 
we make larger projects. In chapter 9 we break free of single lines of code.
