# Scope-Based Resource Management

Rust uses the end of scope as the place to deconstruct and deallocate a resource.

The term for this deconstruction and deallocation is called a drop.

Memory detail:

* Rust does not ahve garbage collection.
* This is also called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization ( RAII ) in C++.
