# Modules

Every Rust program or library is a *crate*.

Every crate is made of a hieracrchy of *modules*.

Every crate has a root module.

A module can hold global variables, functions, structs, traits or even other modules!

In Rust there is not a 1 to 1 mapping of files to the module tree hierarchy. We must
build the module tree explicitly and by hand in our code.
