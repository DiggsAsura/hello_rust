# Creating Modules

When we think of code, we usually imagine a hierarchy of files organized in dictionaries.
Rust lets you create modules closely related to your file structure.

There are two ways in Rust to declare a module. For example, a module **foo** can be 
represented as:

* a file named **foo.rs**
* a dictionary named **foo** with a file **mod.rs** inside
