Ok this is going very slow. I don't find enough time to actually sit down for
any good amount of time.

I also still 2 weeks into quitting nicotince, and to be fair, that also does not help much
on the concentration yet, but its def getting better :D

Slow and steady. Hopefully I get some good progress soon.
